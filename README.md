# Where's Croc Lab Assignment

You are a ranger in Wollomunga national park, in outback Australia. Crocodiles in this park have sensors attached that say where they are and the water conditions (calcium, salinity and alkalinity levels) of the water the crocodile is current swimming in. The park consists of 40 waterholes, each of which is reachable only from its neighbors. The park has records of the calcium, salinity and alkalinity distributions in each waterhole. The sensor on one crocodile, 'Croc', has broken. It no longer says where he is, however it does still provide water condition readings. You need to find Croc. There are also two Swedish backpackers in the park, wandering around at random visiting waterholes. If they end up in the same waterhole as Croc, they will be eaten. Your score is the number of moves it takes to find Croc.
